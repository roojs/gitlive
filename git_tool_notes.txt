idea:

- local version of merger -
* it basically shows the difference between two branches,
as a tree, then as a list of changed files, then diff view

- to do this.

A) select repo 
 current directory (eg.) 'Repo' Class
B) get history
  ....
C) get diff etc...

Lets' start with the Repo directory.
